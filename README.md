# Database
This is a project about creating a database for an online staff evaluation system.

## About
This project was part of the Databases course in the third year of CEID, University of Patras. It was created in collaboration with [@eleftheriavs](https://github.com/eleftheriavs).
It was written using _MySQL_.

The database includes the creation of tables, procedures and triggers necessary for the assgnment's requirements, as well as the insertion of needed data.

## Content
Included is an ER diagramm, showing all the tables, the fields and their properties in each table and the relations of each table with each other.
After that, the entire database and its components are included in the `.sql` file.
A local server was hosted using _MySQL Workbench_, with the latter also being used to help create the project in _MySQL_.
